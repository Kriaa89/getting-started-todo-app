### Verification
```bash
# Verify image attestations
docker buildx imagetools inspect kriaa693/getting-started-todo-app:latest

# Check for SBOM
docker scout sbom kriaa693/getting-started-todo-app:latest

# Verify signatures (if enabled)
cosign verify --key cosign.pub kriaa693/getting-started-todo-app:latest
```
