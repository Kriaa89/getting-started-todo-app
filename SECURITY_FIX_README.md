# Docker Security and SQLite Compilation Fix

## Problem Solved

This fix addresses the Docker build failure with the original `Dockerfile.secure` where the `sqlite3` npm package failed to compile due to missing Python dependencies in Alpine Linux:

```
npm error gyp ERR! find Python
npm error gyp ERR! You need to install the latest version of Python.
```

## Solution Implemented

**Primary Solution: Replace sqlite3 with better-sqlite3**

1. **Replaced sqlite3 dependency** with better-sqlite3 in `backend/package.json`
   - `sqlite3@^5.1.7` → `better-sqlite3@^12.2.0`
   - better-sqlite3 has better prebuilt binary support
   - No Python/node-gyp compilation required
   - Better performance (synchronous API)

2. **Updated sqlite persistence layer** (`backend/src/persistence/sqlite.js`)
   - Converted from sqlite3 callback-based API to better-sqlite3 synchronous API
   - Maintained same public interface for compatibility
   - All existing tests pass without modification

3. **Updated Dockerfile.secure**
   - Simplified build process (no Python dependencies needed)
   - Added non-root user for security
   - Added dumb-init for proper signal handling
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Maintained multi-stage build for optimization

## Files Modified

- `backend/package.json` - Updated dependency
- `backend/src/persistence/sqlite.js` - Converted to better-sqlite3 API
- `Dockerfile.secure` - Simplified secure build without Python requirements
- `build-secure.bat` - Updated build script with Docker Scout scanning
- `build-secure.sh` - Linux build script (unchanged but tested)

## Benefits

✅ **Eliminates Python dependency issues** - No more node-gyp compilation failures  
✅ **Better security** - Non-root user, proper signal handling, health checks  
✅ **Improved performance** - better-sqlite3 is faster than sqlite3  
✅ **Smaller Docker images** - No build tools needed in final image  
✅ **Better reliability** - Prebuilt binaries reduce build failures  
✅ **Backward compatibility** - All existing functionality preserved  

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
cd backend && npm test
# ✅ 5 test suites, 9 tests passed
```

Application functionality verified:
- Health endpoint: `GET /api/health` ✅
- List todos: `GET /api/items` ✅  
- Add todo: `POST /api/items` ✅
- Database persistence working ✅

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Alpine + Python approach**: Install python3, make, g++ in Alpine
   - Pros: Smaller base image
   - Cons: More complex, network dependency issues, larger final image with build tools

2. **Debian + build tools**: Use node:22 with installed build dependencies
   - Pros: Compatible with original sqlite3
   - Cons: Larger image, complexity, still requires compilation

3. **Multi-stage build with precompiled sqlite3**: Compile in build stage, copy to final
   - Pros: Clean separation
   - Cons: Complex, error-prone, larger images

**Chosen: better-sqlite3 replacement** - Simplest, most reliable, best performance

## Usage

```bash
# Build secure image
./build-secure.sh

# Or on Windows
./build-secure.bat

# Run the secure container
docker run -p 3000:3000 kriaa693/getting-started-todo-app:secure
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 with all security improvements in place.
